I am afraid, I am not going to sleep tonight, I will be doing this work! AND AGAIN, I don't know what to do! Today, I got a fine of a big amount of money that I don't really have because I have parked my car in the pedestrian path! STILL I don’t know what to do! Me and my fiancé we are about to get married but as we are Africans our parents require that I have to pay the dowry to my fiancé’s family for them to consent give me her hand. Now they are asking too much money that I don't have! I really don't know what to do!!! 

              THE DAY BEFORE (Wed Oct 02 2019) I WAS …  SAD AND FRUSTRATED!  I GOT THE BAD NEWS, today, that my friend Peter got sick of an incurable disease and now he is at the intensive care section of the Hospital! I FEEL frustrated that my father in law asked me too much dowry!  ME AND MY FIANCÉ we are about to get married but as we are Africans our parents require that I have to pay the dowry to my fiancé’s family for them to consent give me her hand. Now they are asking too much money that I don't have! I don't know what to do!!!
                
              YET, THE DAY BEFORE THAT I WAS..  HAPPY AND EXCITED!  TOMORROW is going to be a public holiday and I have finished all the work that I am supposed to do today! … also my lover said YES … I AM happy that my lover said yes!  IT HAS BEEN MONTHS since me and my fiancé are dating and then today, she said YES! I am the happiest person in the universe.
