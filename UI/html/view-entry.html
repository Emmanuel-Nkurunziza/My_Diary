                Tired! But I still have a lot of things to fix!
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <p class="text-body">
                I don’t know what to do! … It has been a long time without finishing the work that the teacher of
                Computer
                Science left, and the teacher need that we submit the work tomorrow! I am afraid, I am not going to
                sleep
                tonight, I will be doing this work!
                AND AGAIN, I don't know what to do! Today, I got a fine of a big amount of money that I don't really
                have
                because I have parked my car in the pedestrian path!
                STILL I don’t know what to do! Me and my fiancé we are about to get married but as we are Africans our
                parents
                require that I have to pay the dowry to my fiancé’s family for them to consent give me her hand. Now
                they are
                asking too much money that I don't have! I really don't know what to do!!! <br> <br>
                THE DAY BEFORE (Wed Oct 02 2019) I WAS …
                SAD AND FRUSTRATED!
                I GOT THE BAD NEWS, today, that my friend Peter got sick of an incurable disease and now he is at the
                intensive
                care section of the Hospital!
                I FEEL frustrated that my father in law asked me too much dowry!
                ME AND MY FIANCÉ we are about to get married but as we are Africans our parents require that I have to
                pay the
                dowry to my fiancé’s family for them to consent give me her hand. Now they are asking too much money
                that I
                don't have! I don't know what to do!!! <br> <br>
                YET, THE DAY BEFORE THAT (Tues Oct 01 2019) I WAS..
                HAPPY AND EXCITED!
                TOMORROW is going to be a public holiday and I have finished all the work that I am supposed to do
                today! … also
                my lover said YES …
                I AM happy that my lover said yes!
                IT HAS BEEN MONTHS since me and my fiancé are dating and then today, she said YES! I am the happiest
                person in
                the universe.
